- READMEs which end with * (README*) are the ones which should be created in the exact places during specialization/course development as well.
- Simple README are just for explanation purposes. 


# Quiz README

- The idea is to write quizzes in a Microsoft Doc (.docx) which we can then import to the Coursera platform instead of individually writing the questions.
- If you are making this quiz document using Google Docs be sure to download it as a Microsoft Doc (.docx), since this is (one of the) file extension Coursera accepts.
- Uploading the quiz document into the course/specialization repo will help us keep a record of not just the quiz, but also changes made to it over time.
- Within the Document mention the Course #, Week # and the quiz name.
- For a successful import of the questions you have to follow the Coursera Question template, what it is and the different types of question that can be made can be found in the document __Example Question Types for Importing on Coursera__.
- There are also 2 sample quiz files taken from one of our specializations.
- For the name of the quiz file (.docx) weâ€™ll use __C(course #)_W(week #)_Quiz__.
- If there are more than one Quiz in a week then we'll name it as __C(course #)_W(week #)_Quiz_quiz#_quiz-name__.
- When uploading the quiz for the first time you can import this document. When revising any question(s) be sure to select the "Replace" option when importing this document so that all of the previous questions get replaced with the updated versions.
