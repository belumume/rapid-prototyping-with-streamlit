- READMEs that end with _ (README_) are the ones which should be created in the exact places during specialization/course development as well.
- Simple README are just for explanation purposes. 


# Course README

- The Course folder should be named __C(followed by the course #)__. 
      
      - C1
      - C2
      - C3
      - C4
  A specialization can have any number of courses in it, not necessarily 4.
  
- Within the course folder, along with the week folders should be a README file in which we mention the course name. 
  - In case we decide to change the name of the course during development we would only have to change it in the README, this way we won't disrupt the specialization/course repository.
- This README will also contain further necessary details about the course, if any.
