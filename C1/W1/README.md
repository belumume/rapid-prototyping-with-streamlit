- READMEs that end with _ (README_) are the ones which should be created in the exact places during specialization/course development as well.
- Simple README are just for explanation purposes.


# Week README

- The Week folder should be named __W(followed by the week #)__.
      
      - W1
      - W2
      - W3
      - W4
  A course can have any number of weeks in it, not necessarily 4.
- If each Week has a name, create a README file in each Week's folder to place the name in it.
- Within each Week's folder, where applicable, will be seperate folders for __assignment(s)__, _autograder_, and __ungraded_lab(s)__ and __quiz(zes)__.
