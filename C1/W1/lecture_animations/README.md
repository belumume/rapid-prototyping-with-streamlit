- READMEs which end with * (README*) are the ones which should be created in the exact places during specialization/course development as well.
- Simple README are just for explanation purposes. 


# Lecture Animations README

- This folder __lecture-animation(s)__ will be created if and only if a particular week has any animated lecture content.
- If there are more than one version of the lecture animations, we’ll name the notebook files appropriately by adding __v(version #)__ (shown below) and move the older versions into the folder __previous-versions__.
- __previous-versions__ will only be created when we’ll have more than one version. Otherwise this folder won’t exist.
- - Within this folder we also need to create folders, whenever apply, __images__ for saving all of the images that are being used in the notebooks, __data__ for storing the data files being used.


- For the name of the lecture animation notebook file we’ll use **C(course #)_W(week #)_LAN_Lecture-name_name_of_the_file**. Lecture-name will correspond to the lecture name to which the animation belongs to on Coursera. 
- Below are examples for lecture animation notebook file names with varying conditions.
      
      - Lecture Animation file name:
          * C1_W2_LAN_Building-Graphs_Graphs.ipynb
          * C1_W3_LAN_Simple-Plots_Simple_Plots.ipynb
      - Lecture Animation which has more than one version of it:
          * C1_W3_LAN_Simple-Plots_Simple_Plots_v2.ipynb
