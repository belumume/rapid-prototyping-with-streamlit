# Ungraded Lab README

- If there are more than one version of the ungraded lab, we’ll name the lab files appropriately by adding __v(version #)__ (shown below) and move the older versions into the folder __previous-versions__.
- __previous-versions__ will only be created when we’ll have more than one version. Otherwise this folder won’t exist.
- - Within this folder we also need to create folders, whenever apply, __images__ for saving all of the images that are being used in the lab, __data__ for storing the data files being used and __models__ for storing all of the pre-trained models we'll be using in the lab.
- In the name of the ungraded lab file we’ll also mention the platform for which it is used for. 
      
      E.g 
      - Coursera
      - Colab
  * If there is no mention of the platform then by default it will be assumed that the lab is for Coursera.

- For the name of the ungraded lab file we’ll use **C(course #)_W(week #)_Lab(lab #)_Platform-name_name_of_the_lab**.
- Below are examples for ungraded file names with varying conditions
      
      - Ungraded Lab with a platform-name:
          * C1_W2_Lab_3_Colab_Training_Basics.ipynb
      - Ungraded Lab without a platform mention:
          * C1_W2_Lab_3_Training_Basics.ipynb
      - Ungraded Lab which has more than one version of it:
          * C1_W2_Lab_3_Training_Basics_v2.ipynb
