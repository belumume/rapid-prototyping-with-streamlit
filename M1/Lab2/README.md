# M1 Lab 2 - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this second lab, we'll take our first step towards building a Streamlit app for our capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.
Briefly, we'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch, which we'll cover later.

The next video will walk you through how to run Module 1 Lab 2. 

## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list is provided in the requirements.txt file in the GitHub repo.

You can also install them via `pip` as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run Streamlit app for Module 1 Lab 2, from this directory, from your command line, enter `streamlit run` followed by the `streamlit_app.py`: 

```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
