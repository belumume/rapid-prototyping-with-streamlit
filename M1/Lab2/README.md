# M1 L2 Lab 2 - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this lab, we'll take our first step towards building a Streamlit app for our capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.

Briefly, we'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch, which we'll cover later.

## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list of this is provided in the `requirements.txt` file.

You can also install them via `pip` as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run Streamlit apps mentioned herein, you can use `streamlit run` followed by the `streamlit_app.py` script file name and enter them into the terminal:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

and so forth.
