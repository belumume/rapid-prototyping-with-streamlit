# M1 L3 Lab 3

In this lab, we'll build a simple Gen AI app using LLM models from Snowflake Cortex.

We'll start off with a simple app with as minimal number of lines. Next, we'll expand the app with additional features in our iterations as also reflected by the file names `iteration_1.py`, `iteration_2.py`, etc.

## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list of this is provided in the `requirements.txt` file.

You can also install them via `pip` as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run Streamlit apps mentioned herein, you can use `streamlit run` followed by the `.py` script file name of choice.

For example, if you want to run the `iteration_1.py` app, enter the following into the terminal:
```
streamlit run iteration_1.py
```

and so forth.
