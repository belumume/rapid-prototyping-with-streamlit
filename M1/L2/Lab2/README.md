# M1 L2 Lab 2 - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this lab, we'll take our first step towards building a Streamlit app for our capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.

Briefly, we'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch, which we'll cover later.
